<p>This calculator takes a set of initial assumptions in order to estimate the number of days an experiment would need to reach your desired confidence level.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> please take this estimate with a grain of salt! It can be helpful for planning purposes; however, it is not recommended that you rely on the accuracy of this estimate for any critical decision making. Rather, consider the estimate to be in the general order of magnitude of the number of days you may want to run an experiment.</p>
<p>The set of equations employed is extracted in part from <a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2007/10/landing-page-1.html" title="blog post on a/b test analytics" target="_blank">here</a>. 0.8 is used for the Power (1 - Type II error)</p>
