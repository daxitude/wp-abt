<p>This page allows you to create an experiment, add variations, and monitor its progress while running.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Experiment Name (r)</strong> - any descriptive name you'd like to provide for the experiment.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Goal Name (r)</strong> - any descriptive name you'd like to provide for the goal.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Goal Page (r)</strong> - the page on your site that you want to track for conversions.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Desired Confidence</strong> - e.g., 0.9 => 90% confidence that the observed results are true.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Desired Observed Effect</strong> -  aka sensitivity: the change (+/-) in the conversion rate that you'd like to detect.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
	<strong>Status</strong> -  ready, running, and completed. You decide when to stop an experiment. <strong>Tip:</strong> watch for the detectable effect to approach your desired observable effect. Assuming a constant conversion rate, the detectable effect will approach your desired observable effect as total visits increase.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Detectable Effect</strong> -  The amount of change in conversion rate between the base (control) and any variation that can be confidently detected based on your provided confidence level and the number of total experiment visits to date.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Variations</strong> -  the first variation created is automatically set as the base (control) variation. If you delete the base variation before starting the experiment, the next variation in the experiment will be set as the base variation. You can modify variations only before an experiment has been started.
